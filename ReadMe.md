# ML-Cookbook

Recipies for machine learning worth sharing. This project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management. The project strucutre shares major opportunities in machine learning.

### Ponderings ðŸ¤”

[What is code?](https://youtu.be/yk3jL2ToaEk?si=3tvOiPJJ18wLUf8d)

A few philosiphies to keep in mind:

- [There is no free lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem).
- [Predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics) are foundational, but worthless without application.
- Well written [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) deserves more love.
- You don't have to code to add value to a ML workflow, but ignoring it's importance detracts value.
- Use the scientific process: Observe, question, hypothesize, experiment, analyze, then draw conclusions.
