# Rosalind

[Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a platform built to help teach bioinformatics. It provides a curriculum that walks through the solutions for computational problems of varying difficulty. These problems are all extracted from real challenges that are presented in molecular biology.


The platform has a fairly large user base and an active [GitHub Community](https://github.com/topics/rosalind-solutions) that regularly shares solutions to problems. Solutions to problems are checked automatically for accuracy, and your account is given a score based on metadata surrounding your submission.

I strongly encourage developing the algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook, this way you have a solution ready *before* triggering the [ROSALIND SHOT CLOCK](https://youtu.be/9LbSyRvK8Gc?si=XMFGELwiD-QEYqRv)!

## Platform Verbatims

***Rosalind** is inspired by Project Euler, Google Code Jam, and the ever growing movement of free online courses. The project's name commemorates Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography with Raymond Gosling facilitated the discovery of the DNA double helix by Watson and Crick.*

***Mission statement**: We hope that Rosalind will inspire a new generation of bioinformatics students by attracting biologists who want to develop vital programming skills at their own pace in a unique environment as well as programmers who have never been exposed to some of the stimulating computational problems generated by molecular biology.*
