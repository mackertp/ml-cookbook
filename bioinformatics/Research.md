# Context & Research Intent 

The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a global standard for diagnostic health information, called the *International Classification of Diseases*. WHO has currently published the 11th revision, available here: [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/en). 

Keywords, specific disease states, and medical terms can be typed into the [WHO search tool](https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en#149403041), making it easy to start researching areas of human need. When thinking through medications, disease treatments, and preventative care, there are many existing and effective approaches to treat some ICD codes, while other codes have limited options and no "cure" that is known (i.e. [6D80.1](https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en#1855418451)). 

Specific disease states always have unique considerations. This is where deep research becomes relevant and is usually kept private. Publicly available information, such as this repo, serve as references for inquiring minds. When evaluating the use of chemical products to treat disease, extensive work on [biological assays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/bioassay#:~:text=Biological%20assays%20are%20analytical%20techniques,specific%20to%20the%20target%20protein) must be completed and reviewed before progressing into [clinical trial design](https://www.fda.gov/patients/clinical-trials-what-patients-need-know/basics-about-clinical-trials). The data from clinical trials is analyzed extensively before a "medicine" is able to be commercialized. 

All research must cope with the cost considerations surrounding it. Historically, the cost of material would be a significant limiting factor for research progression - the more experiments, the more materials and higher risk of wasted material. With the advancement of *Artificial Intelligence*, new modalities have been created to conduct research synthetically.

The subdirectories in this repository share several different approaches to help aspiring researchers bootstrap their project ideas. The notes and content shared on this repository do not contain "ground-breaking" research, but I hope someone gets a kick out of it.


## Health Tech 

The history of [collecting and organizing patient health records for research goes back to the 5th century BC](https://lithub.com/what-the-worlds-first-medical-records-tell-us-about-ancient-life/), as there has always been an innate urge to solve for human diseases. Modern day hospital systems continue to innovate *Electronic Health Record* systems to document and track the actual patient cases they are presented with.

There is so much history and shared knowledge to evaluate, however the project that yielded the greatest scientific *return on investment* is perhaps the [Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project). This project kicked off massive research investments into [*Genomic Medicine*](https://www.genome.gov/health/Genomics-and-Medicine#:~:text=Genomic%20medicine%20is%20an%20emerging,implications%20of%20that%20clinical%20use.) and *algorithmic* solutions to disease state management. The research and technology that stemmed from the Human Genome project has been woven deep into the design patterns and architectures of almost all of today's web-based software solutions.

Since the project ended in the early 2000s, industry giants have continued to develop and invest in Healthcare AI. Government research is high on the US priority list, along with [expansions in Medicare](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/04/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-rule-expanding-access-care-increasing-protections-people-medicare-advantage-medicare-part-d.html#:~:text=The%20Contract%20Year%20(CY)%202025,inappropriate%20marketing%20and%20prior%20authorization.) to ensure that people are able to access innovations that are brought to market.
