# Context & Research Intent 

The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a global standard for diagnostic health information, called the *International Classification of Diseases*. WHO has currently published the 11th revision, available here: [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/en). 

Keywords, specific disease states, and medical terms can be typed into the [WHO search tool](https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en#149403041), making it easy to start researching areas of human need. When thinking through medications, disease treatments, and preventative care, there are many existing and effective approaches to study.

Specific diseases have unique considerations. When evaluating the use of chemical products to treat disease, extensive work on [biological assays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/bioassay#:~:text=Biological%20assays%20are%20analytical%20techniques,specific%20to%20the%20target%20protein) must be completed and reviewed before progressing into [clinical trial design](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/clinical-trials-and-human-subject-protection/clinical-trials-guidance-documents). The data from clinical trials is analyzed extensively before a "medicine" is able to be commercialized. 

All research must cope with the cost considerations surrounding it. Historically, the cost of material would be a significant limiting factor for research progression - the more experiments, the more materials and higher risk of wasted material. With the advancement of *Artificial Intelligence*, new modalities have been created to conduct research synthetically.

A few of the global industries that need to cope with these challenges:

- Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology ðŸ”¬
- Petrochemical and Energy
- Agriculture
- Consumer Products
- Materials Science and Polymers
- Environmental Science
- Manufacturing and Industrial Processes
- Food and Beverage
- Healthcare and Medical Devices
- Automotive and Aerospace
