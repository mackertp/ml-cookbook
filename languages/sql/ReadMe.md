# Structured Query Language

[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), or *structured query language* is the language of relational databases. Data is stored so that it can be analyzed and used in a variety of means. SQL lets us query databases, manipulate the data within them, and create stored procedures to filter, clean, and "refine" data. The language was initially developed at IBM in the early 70s and can be found today pretty much wherever a database exists.

This folder will deomstrate some basic SQL, wrapped around contextual language in Jupyter Notebooks. High level scripting languages, such as python, allow us to embed SQL into notebooks, scripts, and applications. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_sql.html) provides us the ability to quickly pull SQL into a *dataframe*, where it can be visualized and further analyzed.
