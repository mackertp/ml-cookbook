# Robot Operating System

[ROS](https://www.ros.org/blog/getting-started/) is a low level linux distribution that works in tandem with your operating system. ROS installations come with a suite of software libraries that help developers expand on existing robotics research. This includes drivers, algorithms, and tools that help ease the learning process and ensure we are never "reinventing the wheel". Applications are typically focused on connecting hardware data into a central operating system.

The best part about ROS is that it is all open source! Yearly releases are scheduled on [world turtle day](https://www.worldturtleday.org/). Explore the [*Humble Hawksbill* build](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html), and [consider contributing](https://youtu.be/CMNry4PE93Y?si=1RZ-EEMJOp-Ycs--).
