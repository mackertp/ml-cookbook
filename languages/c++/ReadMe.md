# C++

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language is widely used within operating systems, web browsers, microcontrollers and video games - providing flexibility and low level application logic.

To run C++ code, you will need a compiler. The [GNU Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) is automatically installed if you have a mac (if you have Windows or Linux, some configuration will be required). 

I created an introductory application in the 'simple-app' directory. To run the app, open your terminal and from the 'simple-app' directory, run: 

```console
uname@os:~$ g++ prime.cpp
uname@os:~$ ./a.out
```
