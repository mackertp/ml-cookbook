# R

The [R programming lanugage](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and several of his colleagues. The language provides an integrated suite of software to facilitate data manipulation, calculation, and visualization. The language boasts:

- effective data handling and storage
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays and matrices
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy
- an elegant implementation of input and outputs, conditionals, loops, and user-defined recursive functions

C, C++ and Fortran code can all be linked and called at run time within R. As you'll see in this repository, R is also able to run in a python notebook environemnt - all you need to do is appropriately set up a kernel.
