I believe that better public understanding and more meaningful intention on the utilization of these tools is essential for future generations and businesses.

    "\n",
    "~3 years removed from ChatGPT's initial launch, the LLM landscape has ballooned with many players in the software space trying to either improve or replace their existing products, platforms, and services. The game is always evolving. \n",

    "Below are a few of [the top options](https://youtu.be/5CYxxgbd3RU?si=spSCLHgU_jLZXeZE) available:\n",

    "- [Grok](https://grok.com/chat) exists because Elon Musk got into a spat with Sam Altman and never let it go. Now [he's on a mission](https://youtu.be/dbgL00a7_xs?si=wlLvmrMEQBsXBK6D) to just be better.\n",

    "- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) is getting better every day, trying to shed that image of the [Bard launch](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Google-Gemini) in 2023. Google's strength lies in it's research, software engineering capabilities, and scale of compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/dsZvbsxNJDM8QDZ92hQcc) leaves you realizing that the price tag to fully integrate a LLM with your PowerPoints was [~$10B USD](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/27/microsoft-confirms-its-10-billion-investment-into-chatgpt-changing-how-microsoft-competes-with-google-apple-and-other-tech-giants/), thanks Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [IBM Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/playground/) is the culmination of the firm's extensive AI research, which spans decades. Also, they have a lot of patents. \n",

    "Many other products exist that leverage these services through \"Application Programming Interfaces\" (APIs) and are made available as [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) products. To start, I'll use what I already have... my Apple© operating system and Python."

      "Think of it like this:\n",

      "*   **Characteristics:** Ducks are typically smaller than geese and swans, have relatively short necks, webbed feet, and flattened bills. They are aquatic birds, found in both fresh and saltwater environments around the world.\n",

      "*   **Commonality:** It is arguably the most common and widely recognized duck species in the Northern Hemisphere, known for its adaptability to various environments, including urban parks.\n",
      "*   **Distinguishing Features:**\n",
      "    *   **Male (Drake):** Easily identifiable by its iridescent green head, a white neck ring, a chestnut breast, and grey flanks.\n",
      "    *   **Female (Hen):** Mottled brown with an orange and brown bill, providing excellent camouflage.\n",
      "    *   **Bill:** Their bills are typically yellowish-orange.\n",
      "*   **Behavior:** Mallards are \"dabbling ducks,\" meaning they feed by tipping their bodies upside down in shallow water to reach submerged vegetation and invertebrates, rather than diving completely underwater.\n",
      "*   **Ancestry:** Mallards are significant because they are the ancestors of most domestic duck breeds (like Pekin ducks, Rouen ducks, etc.).\n",

    "- **Website Architecture**: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is the most capable Python backend and allows for seamless integration with any JavaScript front-end. Selected for durability, code reliability, and scalability.

    "- **Analytics Server Architecture**: A small [JupyterHub](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/) will do the trick. You just need a linux-based server to connect to. Since the database is set up on our website, we can pull information to analyze via API into the Jupyter server (for a large enough business, you might want to entertain hardware investments to create a private cloud for this application with dedicated storage and compute).\n",
