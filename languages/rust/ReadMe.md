# Rust

Graydon Hoare started Rust as a personal project in 2006 while working at Mozilla. It stemmed from his observations when his apartment building's elevator broke. As a software developer at Mozilla, Graydon understood the issues with his elevator typically are due to memory management. These systems are typically written in C or C++, which require significant memory management that leads to developer errors that cause crashes. Hoare set to work on figuring out how to create a programming language that could be both compact and memory bug-free.

Mozilla sponsered Hoare's project in 2009 as part of a longer-term effort to incorporate the language into an experimental browser engine. Mozilla Research officially announced the Rust project and released it's source code in 2010 as an open-source project. 

Rust has picked up steam since it's initial release and continues to gain adoption among tech leaders. The opportuities to rewrite low-level, high-performance C++ and C code in Rust is appealing to many.
