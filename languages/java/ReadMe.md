# Java â˜•

Java is a widely used language for creating applications and systems. Some of it's core features include a simple syntax, object orientation, and a robust, secure ecosystem that is capable of running on any platform. To get a little more familiar with the language, look at [javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-basics#:~:text=Simple%3A%20Java%20is%20a%20simple,the%20form%20of%20the%20object.) for some excellent free resources.

Java has recently added [JShell](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm), a fantastic tool that ships with the latest JDK 9. Verify your installation by running the command and then exiting:

```console
uname@os:~$ jshell
jshell:~$ /exit
```
