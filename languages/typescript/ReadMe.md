# Typescript 

TypeScript is an open-source programming language that will work on any browser, OS, and environment that supports JavaScript. It adds *types* to JavaScript, which are designed to help speed up the development process through catching errors before running the JavaScript code. 

Anders Hejlsberg created TypeScript in 2010 at Microsoft, and its first version was available to the public in 2012. I'll use a [TypeScript tutorial](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/) as a guide for working through the details of this programming language. To get started, let's use Jupyter to keep things tidy and to the point. Install [tslab](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslab) globally and then the kernel with tslab:

```console
uname@os:~$ npm install -g tslab
uname@os:~$ tslab install
```
If you're experienced with TypeScript and application frameworks, I recommend starting with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/react-vite).
